## Notes & Ideas

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Consider Shadcn/UI for component library
- Look into Meilisearch for search indexing
- Evaluate Electron/Tauri for native launcher

### Questions to Answer
- [ ] Where will games be hosted? (subdomain, S3, itch.io?)
- [ ] What's the deployment target? (Vercel, Netlify, self-hosted?)
- [ ] Any existing games to add to catalog?

## Metrics Tracking

*To be filled once MVP is running*

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Catalog size | 50+ games | 0 |
| Page load time | < 2s | - |
| Lighthouse score | 90+ | - |
